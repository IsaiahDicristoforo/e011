Project Euler Tribute Problem I created

In the given file, data.txt, what is the largest prime number consisting of all prime digits? For this problem we will allow 1 to be considered prime. We will call this the "Hannah Prime"

Each line of the file is seperate: do not continue a possible prime from one line to the next.
